# Customer Behavior Prediction System

## Overview

The **Customer Behavior Prediction System** is a data analytics project designed to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Utilizing Python for data processing and MySQL for database management, this system enables precise classification of customers into distinct segments—**High Spenders**, **Medium Spenders**, and **Low Spenders**—to facilitate targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Features

- **Customer Segmentation**: Classifies customers into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low Spenders** based on purchase amounts.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy** for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Database Integration**: Employs **MySQL** for seamless storage and updating of customer records.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on customer segments for business decision-making.

## Technologies

- **Python**: For data analysis and processing
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation
  - **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **MySQL**: For database management
- **CSV**: For data import and export
